This automates installation and configuration of a linux machine to my liking.
Much like everyone's dotfiles or my previous project called 'amir-taninfiles'.

While working on an iteration of my previous machine-bootstrap project, I
realized that I can use Ansible to automate all of that tedious bash magic.
Here comes: **amirize-this-machine**.
